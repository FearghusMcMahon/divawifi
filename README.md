Based on https://github.com/diva/diva-distribution but trimmed down to be able to checkout into an opensim build so that it can be build in that.

Checkout into addon-modules folder in the OpenSim checkout (not the one in the bin folder!)
And fire off runprebuild.bat on windows or runprebuild.sh on linux.

After that build your opensim as usual.
